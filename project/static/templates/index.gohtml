                        I am a Software Support Engineer/Developer, specializing in 
                        Cloud based web apps. I’ve always found myself comfortable 
                        contributing to teams of all sizes, working towards developing the 
                        best products for customers. Currently, I’m conducting part time contracting 
                        work and educating myself on different CI/CD technologies to integrate into 
                        my projects. Around my colleagues, I'm known for my leadership skills and 
                        cooperation with team members, (including helpful learning practices such as 
                        detailed documentation and peered programming around new discoveries).
