                        In my current role of Software Production Support at Centene, I get to work with a lot of IDE’s,
                        languages, and technology stacks. There’s system/server monitoring like TIBCO Queues and Kibana,
                        Oracle and MS SQL where I help develop and run queries in a Production environment, SSIS packages
                        for ETL data loads, as well as Python, C++, and Java in my assistant development work.
                        I’m currently learning Golang and Mongo for our company's NextGen application push!
                        The technology stack is getting higher and higher!

                        I have experience working with a diverse group of people to make a variety of digital
                        and analog games. I can navigate the Unreal Engine for game design, as well as Maya/Blender
                        for 3-D modeling/texturing. I also know C++, Java, and Python, but am willing to learn any software/language
                        used to get the job done.
