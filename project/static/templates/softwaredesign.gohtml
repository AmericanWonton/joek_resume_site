                        My current project involves building a series of adjoining Microservices to deliver text Messages to Users
                        from other Users on my Website. These are called 'LearnRs', and the intent is to send these LearnRs
                        as a means to educate someone you care about on a topic they are misinformed on. This can include 
                        testimonies, links to research, and other factoids about a subject.
                        <br>
                        This is currently in Beta, but you should be able to create a test Organization and
                        LearnR to test amongst yourselves. (Note, in the future, I plan to establish a safeguard
                        for future LearnRs to curate any misinformation or ill content.) Check it out

                        This project involved me building a simple set of messageboards build around a series
                        of Micro-services,(including ones for sending email/text updates, managing CRUD operations,
                        and hosting the web application to communicate with each other). Each separate service has its
                        own Docker container hosted on an AWS server. Updating each service is as simple as pushing
                        the new container and rebooting the EC2 Instance with updates managed through a CRON jobs on reboot.

                        This one is still in the works,(mostly because I’m attempting to document my
                        progress as soon as I make updates). I’m hoping this is a project I can utilize
                        when tackling larger projects as an example piece! Check it out

                        A project I started a little before Covid involves building a ‘mock-database’ with MongoDB and MySQL.
                        It currently runs as a docker-process on an AWS linux server.
                        I also have built a mock API that creates random Users, discards
                        'junk data', and sends me logging information to monitor the health
                        of the database.
                        <br>
                        I hope to add a number of features soon, such as AWS bucket file storage,
                        formatted Excel sheets to download, extended Admin privelages,
