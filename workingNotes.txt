To Do List:

1. Try to make a form that will take information and submit an email to me.
5. Actually make the page look good.
6. Find and apply some good fonts.
10. Give 'The Crazies' a download link! Is it on Amazon writer?! There's a BUNCH of links missing!
7. Figure out to have a big picture display when User clicks on a picture,(like Confluence)
7. Maybe make a 'FavIcon',(that shit Websites have with the logo on the tab screen)
8. Change our pngs to fancy bitmaps
11. Can we make the animations smoother?


So apparently if you want flexbox to work sometimes, you just need 'wrap'...not row wrap or column wrap...the hell?

Also, to make the Youtube vids work, you have to put EMBED in the links before the unique ID.

Welp, I have a premium account on IMGBIN now for good ass PNGS...

Having a really shitty time turning SVGs from PNGs on GIMP and elsewhere....it keeps losing color and shit.
Downloading InkScape to see if that will work well...
