To Do List:

1. Try to make a form that will take information.
4. Insert Logo pictures down in the footer and header.
5. Actually make the page look good.
6. Find an inspirational Quote
7. Find out how to enter phone numbers in correctly.

Also, to make the Youtube vids work, you have to put EMBED in the links before the unique ID.
