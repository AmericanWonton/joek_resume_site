To Do List:

1. Try to make a form that will take information.
2. Make a div that can do sliding photos for those content sections.
3. Figure out how to have Users download a file from a link.
4. Insert Logo pictures down in the footer and header.
5. Figure out how to let Users download my Resume

So apparently if you want flexbox to work sometimes, you just need 'wrap'...not row wrap or column wrap...the hell?
