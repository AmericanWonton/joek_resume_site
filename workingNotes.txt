To Do List:

1. Try to make a form that will take information.
2. Put in a pretty 'above the fold' background image from Colorado.
4. Still need logos for Microsoft Word, PDF, and a name tag for my name.
5. Actually make the page look good.
6. Find and apply some good fonts.
7. Maybe make a 'FavIcon',(that shit Websites have with the logo on the tab screen)


So apparently if you want flexbox to work sometimes, you just need 'wrap'...not row wrap or column wrap...the hell?

Also, to make the Youtube vids work, you have to put EMBED in the links before the unique ID.
