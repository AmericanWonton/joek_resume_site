To Do List:

1. FOR NOW: We will have our form have no validation...we'll come back to it later! For now, we shall
pretty this baby up!

So apparently if you want flexbox to work sometimes, you just need 'wrap'...not row wrap or column wrap...the hell?

Also, to make the Youtube vids work, you have to put EMBED in the links before the unique ID.

Welp, I have a premium account on IMGBIN now for good ass PNGS...

Having a really shitty time turning SVGs from PNGs on GIMP and elsewhere....it keeps losing color and shit.
Downloading InkScape to see if that will work well...

How to get this website online: 
Overview Steps:
STEP1: By a name with Google Domains,(or find out how to transfer with SquareSpace).
STEP2: Go to the Google Cloud Developer Console to create a new Project with a Project ID(HOLD ON TO PROJECT ID)
STEP3: You need two files that you need in the root to any site you want to deploy to Google Cloud, (Todd has em', it's a YAML file 
and something else and MAIN.go)
STEP4: in the YAML file, put the Cloud Project ID in the 'application' spot
STEP5: deploy project, (go to terminal with that phrase Todd has in the video)
STEP6: You can find website at the appID.appspot.com
STEP7: You need to change the DNS info at Google domains. You have to point your domain to the appengine project 
STEP8: FOR ABOVE, go to Google Domains, go to manage my domains, configure DNS, then 'domain forwarding',(watch the video, it might 
have changed from when Todd did it last).

IN-DEPTH STEPS
STEP 1: Go to Google Domain and search some domains,(or go through SquareSpace, you got the code from them.)
You could try 'domain name generator' or something clever to generate a website name
STEP 2: Google is a CDN...content Delivery Network...servers everywhere to deliver your stuff. It's better cuz it's a lot
of servers everywhere.
STEP 3: Go to Google Cloud. Go to Platform as a service,(App Engine, IIAS). Click on View App Engine Docs
Sleect standard Golang environment.
You gotta download and install the SDK
STEP 4: Download, click go 64 bit. There's a checksum to make sure you downloaded the correct thing.
STEP 5: Launch the installation, extract the zip or whatever,(I'm gunna put it in the D drive).
STEP 6: There should be a GOENGINE you can click into. You need to add the environment variables to the folder path.
STEP 7: You need to check if Python is installed: In the bash, type in the following: python -v
