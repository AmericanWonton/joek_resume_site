To Do List:

1. Try to make a form that will take information.
2. Make a div that can animate picture changes when buttons are clicked on.
4. Insert Logo pictures down in the footer and header.

So apparently if you want flexbox to work sometimes, you just need 'wrap'...not row wrap or column wrap...the hell?
